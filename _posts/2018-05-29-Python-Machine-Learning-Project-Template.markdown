# Introduction

Recently, it came to my notice that I need to focus on improve coding quality, I have modified my previous template for python related machine learning projects, added pylint and based on Cookiecutter project structure. I will continue to add some example project code to this repo [python-ml-structure](https://github.com/mengdong/python-ml-structure)
